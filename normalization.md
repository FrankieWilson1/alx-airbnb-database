# Normalize My Database Design

## Application of normalization principles to ensure the database is in the third normal form (3NF).

### Key Advantages of My Design: 
- **Normalization**: I have effectively implemented normalization techniques to reduce redundancy and enhance data integrity. Each entity is assigned its own table, with relationships managed through foreign keys.
- **Clear Relationships**: The utilization of foreign keys and the implied cardinalities accurately represents real-world interactions. - - **UUIDs as Primary Keys**: I chose a contemporary and reliable option for unique identifiers, particularly suitable for distributed systems.
- **Data Integrity**: The application of NOT NULL, UNIQUE, and CHECK constraints (for ratings) helps maintain data quality.

### In Summary:
This schema serves as a strong and adaptable foundation for my property rental application. I have clearly demonstrated a solid understanding of the fundamental principles of database design!
