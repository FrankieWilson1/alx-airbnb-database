# Database Performance Monitoring and Refinement Report

## Objective

This report details the process of continuously monitoring and refining database performance. It involves analyzing the execution plans of frequently used queries, identifying bottlenecks, suggesting and implementing schema adjustments (like new indexes), and reporting the observed improvements.

## Introduction to Performance Monitoring Tools

* **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (PostgreSQL, and similar in other databases):** This command is invaluable. It not only shows the estimated query plan but also *executes* the query and provides actual runtime statistics (e.g., planning time, execution time, actual rows, loops, buffer usage). It's crucial for understanding where the query spends its time.
* **`SHOW PROFILE` (MySQL):** This command (when enabled) provides detailed profiling information about the execution of statements, breaking down time spent in different stages (e.g., `Creating tmp table`, `Sorting result`). It's useful for pinpointing specific operations that consume a lot of time.

For this report, I will primarily focus on interpreting `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` output.

## Monitored Queries and Initial Analysis

Let's consider two hypothetical "frequently used" complex queries that might emerge from an application and analyze their initial performance.

---

### Query 1: Complex Property Search with Availability

**Scenario:** Users frequently search for properties in a specific location available within a given date range, also filtering by a minimum price, and results are sorted by price.

**Query SQL (Initial):**

```sql
SELECT
    P.name AS property_name,
    P.location,
    P.pricepernight,
    B.start_date,
    B.end_date,
    B.status AS booking_status
FROM
    Property P
JOIN
    Booking B ON P.property_id = B.property_id
WHERE
    P.location = 'New York'
    AND P.pricepernight >= 100
    AND B.start_date <= '2025-08-15' -- Available before or on this date
    AND B.end_date >= '2025-08-01'   -- Available after or on this date
    AND B.status = 'confirmed'
ORDER BY
    P.pricepernight ASC, B.start_date ASC;
```

**Hypothetical Initial EXPLAIN ANALYZE Observations (Before Refinement):**

```
"Sort  (cost=1250.50..1255.50 rows=2000 width=...) (actual time=50.000..55.000 rows=1500 loops=1)"
"  Sort Key: p.pricepernight, b.start_date"
"  ->  Hash Join  (cost=500.00..1000.00 rows=2000 width=...) (actual time=20.000..40.000 rows=1500 loops=1)"
"        Hash Cond: (p.property_id = b.property_id)"
"        ->  Seq Scan on property p  (cost=0.00..400.00 rows=5000 width=...) (actual time=5.000..15.000 rows=5000 loops=1)"
"              Filter: ((location = 'New York'::text) AND (pricepernight >= 100::numeric))"
"        ->  Hash  (cost=300.00..300.00 rows=3000 width=...)"
"              ->  Seq Scan on booking b  (cost=0.00..300.00 rows=3000 width=...) (actual time=5.000..15.000 rows=3000 loops=1)"
"                    Filter: ((start_date <= '2025-08-15'::date) AND (end_date >= '2025-08-01'::date) AND (status = 'confirmed'::text))"
"Planning Time: 0.500 ms"
"Execution Time: 55.500 ms"
```

**Identified Bottlenecks:**

1. **Seq Scan on Property:** Despite having indexes on location and pricepernight individually, the combined WHERE clause might not be fully optimized by separate indexes, leading to a sequential scan.
  
2. **Seq Scan on Booking:** The complex date range filter along with status may lead to a sequential scan if the existing index isn't fully utilized.

3. **Sort Operation:** The ORDER BY clause indicates an explicit sort operation, which can be resource-intensive.

### Query 2: User Booking Summary (Aggregated)

**Scenario:** An admin dashboard needs a summary of total bookings and total amount spent for users who have booked properties in 'Los Angeles', sorted by the total amount spent.

**Query SQL (Initial):**

```sql
SELECT
    U.user_id,
    U.first_name,
    U.last_name,
    COUNT(B.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
    SUM(B.total_price) AS total_spent
FROM
    Users U
JOIN
    Booking B ON U.user_id = B.user_id
JOIN
    Property P ON B.property_id = P.property_id
WHERE
    P.location = 'Los Angeles'
GROUP BY
    U.user_id, U.first_name, U.last_name
ORDER BY
    total_spent DESC;
```

**Hypothetical Initial EXPLAIN ANALYZE Observations (Before Refinement):**

```
"Sort  (cost=2500.00..2550.00 rows=1000 width=...) (actual time=120.000..130.000 rows=500 loops=1)"
"  Sort Key: (sum(b.total_price)) DESC"
"  ->  HashAggregate  (cost=2000.00..2000.00 rows=1000 width=...) (actual time=100.000..110.000 rows=500 loops=1)"
"        Group Key: u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name"
"        ->  Hash Join  (cost=500.00..1500.00 rows=5000 width=...) (actual time=20.000..80.000 rows=10000 loops=1)"
"              Hash Cond: (b.property_id = p.property_id)"
"              ->  Hash Join  (cost=300.00..1000.00 rows=5000 width=...) (actual time=10.000..50.000 rows=10000 loops=1)"
"                    Hash Cond: (u.user_id = b.user_id)"
"                    ->  Seq Scan on users u  (cost=0.00..200.00 rows=10000 width=...)"
"                    ->  Hash  (cost=150.00..150.00 rows=10000 width=...)"
"                          ->  Seq Scan on booking b  (cost=0.00..150.00 rows=10000 width=...)"
"              ->  Hash  (cost=100.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=...)"
"                    ->  Seq Scan on property p  (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=...)"
"                          Filter: (location = 'Los Angeles'::text)"
"Planning Time: 0.800 ms"
"Execution Time: 130.500 ms"
```

**Identified Bottlenecks:**

1. **Multiple Seq Scan Operations:** Large scans on Users and Booking tables indicate inefficiency in filtering.

2. **HashAggregate:** Can consume significant memory/CPU if the aggregation involves a large intermediate result set.

3. **Sort Operation:** The ORDER BY total_spent DESC again causes an explicit sort, which can be slow, especially on aggregated results.

---

## Suggested Changes and Implementation

### For Query 1: Complex Property Search with Availability

**Problem:** Inefficient filtering on Property and Booking tables and an explicit sort.

**Suggested Changes:**

1. **Composite Index on Property:**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_property_loc_price ON Property (location, pricepernight);
   ```

2. **Composite Index on Booking:**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_booking_status_dates_prop ON Booking (status, start_date, end_date, property_id);
   ```

### For Query 2: User Booking Summary (Aggregated)

**Problem:** Multiple sequential scans and an explicit sort on an aggregated value.

**Suggested Changes:**

1. **Ensure FK Indexes are Optimal:** Ensure `Booking.user_id` and `Booking.property_id` have efficient indexes.

2. **Index on Property.location:**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_property_location ON Property (location);
   ```

3. **Consider a Covering Index for Aggregation:**
   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user_price ON Booking (user_id, total_price);
   ```

4. **Materialized View:**
   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW user_booking_summary AS
   SELECT
       U.user_id,
       U.first_name,
       U.last_name,
       COUNT(B.booking_id) AS total_bookings,
       SUM(B.total_price) AS total_spent
   FROM
       Users U
   JOIN
       Booking B ON U.user_id = B.user_id
   JOIN
       Property P ON B.property_id = P.property_id
   WHERE
       P.location = 'Los Angeles'
   GROUP BY
       U.user_id, U.first_name, U.last_name;

   -- To refresh data periodically
   -- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW user_booking_summary;
   ```

## Reporting Improvements

The following changes has to be implemented to achieve a significat improvements :

1. Implement the suggested changes: Execute the `CREATE INDEX` or `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statements.
  
2. Clear Caches: In a test environment, clear database caches to ensure a fresh benchmark.

3. Re-run EXPLAIN ANALYZE for each optimized query:
   ```sql
   -- For Query 1 after new indexes
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   SELECT
       -- ... (your Query 1 SQL) ...
   FROM
       Property P
   JOIN
       Booking B ON P.property_id = B.property_id
   WHERE
       P.location = 'New York'
       AND P.pricepernight >= 100
       AND B.start_date <= '2025-08-15'
       AND B.end_date >= '2025-08-01'
       AND B.status = 'confirmed'
   ORDER BY
       P.pricepernight ASC, B.start_date ASC;

   -- For Query 2 after new indexes / Materialized View
   EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   SELECT *
   FROM user_booking_summary
   ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
   ```

## Expected Improvements in EXPLAIN ANALYZE Output

1. **Replacing Seq Scan with Index Scan:** You should see Index Scan using the new indexes instead of full table scans.

2. **Lower cost values:** The estimated cost of the query plan should drop significantly.

3. **Lower actual time (Execution Time):** The real-world execution time should decrease.

4. **Elimination of Sort / Using filesort:** The explicit Sort operation might disappear or show much lower costs.

5. **Faster Aggregation:** If a covering index is used for Query 2's aggregation, the HashAggregate operation might become more efficient.

6. **Near-instantaneous reads for Materialized Views:** Queries against a materialized view will be extremely fast.

## Conclusion: The Importance of Continuous Monitoring

This exercise highlights that database performance optimization is an iterative and ongoing process. 

1. **Monitoring is Key:** Regularly using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (or `SHOW PROFILE`) on frequently used or slow-running queries is crucial for identifying performance regressions or areas for further improvement.

2. **Adaptive Schema Adjustments:** Database schemas and indexes should evolve with application usage. Adding new composite indexes or implementing advanced techniques like materialized views can yield significant performance gains.

3. **Balance:** It's important to balance read performance with write performance and overall system complexity. Not every query needs to be micro-optimized, but critical paths and high-volume operations certainly do.

By continually monitoring and refining, you ensure your database remains performant and scalable as your application grows.
