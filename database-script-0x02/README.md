# Seed Database with Sample Data (`seed.sql`)

This directory contains `seed.sql`, a SQL script designed to populate the alx-AirBnB database with sample entries for learning purposes.

## Purpose

The `seed.sql` script serves to:
* Insert sample `Users` with different roles (guest, host).
* Add a sample `Property` linked to a host.
* Create a sample `Booking` for that property by a guest.
* Record a sample `Payment` for the booking.
* Include a sample `Review` for the property.
* Demonstrate a sample `Message` exchange between users.

This script uses manually provided UUIDs for clarity in sample data relationships. In a real-world application, UUIDs for new records would typically be generated by the database or the application.
